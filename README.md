# Virtual-Mouse
Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse makes human-computer interaction simple by making use of Hand Gestures.
The computer requires almost no direct contact.
All input and output operations can be virtually controlled by using static and dynamic hand gestures 
This project makes use of state-of-art Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to recognize hand gestures
